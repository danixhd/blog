            <h3>To say plastic pollution is a widespread problem is not doing it justice: </h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Only about 9% of all plastic ever made has likely been recycled with 12% of all plastic waste having been incinerated. The remaining 79% has accumulated in either landfill or the natural environment if not still in use.
                One million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year from plastic pollution in our oceans.
                We put together this list of eco friendly products to show you just how easy it can be to replace some of the plastic products you buy and support those making products out of recycled plastic. By replacing them, you can virtually eliminate your single use plastic waste in that area. By purchasing recycled plastic products you are helping to close the loop of the circular economy.
